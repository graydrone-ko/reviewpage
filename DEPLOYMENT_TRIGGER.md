# RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - 2025-09-08

## Current Issue
Railway is serving React static files instead of Express backend server.

## Expected Fix
With updated railway.json configuration:
- Build Command: `npm ci && npx prisma generate && npm run build` 
- Start Command: `npx prisma migrate deploy && npm start`
- Health Check: `/health` should return JSON (not HTML)

## API Endpoints Should Work
- `/api/surveys/templates` → JSON response with templates
- `/health` → JSON health status
- All backend routes should be functional

## Template Loading Solution
Backend has automatic template creation logic in `getTemplates()` function.
When no templates exist, it automatically creates the default 5-stage template.

This file modification should trigger Railway auto-deployment.
