# Final Deployment Verification

## Issue Status
Railway is still serving only API response instead of React frontend.

## Root Cause Analysis
Railway build process may not be:
1. Running the correct build script from root package.json
2. Successfully building and copying frontend files
3. Finding the static files at runtime

## Expected Behavior
- https://reviewpage-production.up.railway.app/ should show Korean homepage
- Static files should be accessible at /static/js/main.*.js
- React router should work for SPA navigation

## Current Behavior  
- Only JSON API response: {"status":"OK","message":"ReviewPage Backend API","version":"1.0.0"}
- 404 errors for static assets
- No React application loading

## Next Steps
Verify Railway build configuration and file structure in production environment.
