# FORCE RAILWAY REDEPLOY TRIGGER

This file is created to trigger Railway auto-deployment.

## Current Issue
- Railway is serving React app instead of Express backend
- API endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON
- Template loading failing due to incorrect backend deployment

## Expected Solution  
- Railway should build and deploy backend Express server
- API endpoints should return JSON responses
- Survey templates should load correctly

## Timestamp
Generated: 2025-09-08 13:35:00

## Deploy Command
The Railway configuration should execute:
```
cd backend && npm ci && npm run build
cd backend && npm start
```

This will serve the integrated Express server with React frontend routes.
