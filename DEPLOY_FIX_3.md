# Deployment Fix #3 - Frontend Build Issue

## Problem Identified
Railway was not serving the React frontend because:
1. Frontend build files were missing from backend/public/
2. index.html was not present, causing Express to serve API response instead

## Solution Applied
1. Rebuilt React frontend with correct API configuration
2. Copied all build files to backend/public/ including index.html
3. Verified static file serving setup in Express

## Expected Result
https://reviewpage-production.up.railway.app should now show:
- Complete homepage with all sections
- Working signup/login functionality
- Template loading features

## Build Process
- `npm run build:frontend` creates React build
- Files copied to backend/public/
- Express serves static files + handles API routes
